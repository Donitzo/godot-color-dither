# Godot Color Dither

![Sample](https://github.com/Donitzo/godot-color-dither/blob/main/images/sample.png)

## Description

Multicolored dithering shaders for Godot 4. The shaders work by replacing the colors of 2D nodes, 3D nodes or the entire screen with pre-planned dithering patterns of one or more colors taken from a `dither palette` image. The resulting dither mix roughly approximates the original color.

The dithering algorithms used in color selection for the dither palette images are based on code and algorithms by Joel Yliluoma. You can read more about his algorithms in this article: [Joel Yliluoma's arbitrary-palette positional dithering algorithm](https://bisqwit.iki.fi/story/howto/dither/jy/).

## Demo

The [demo project](https://donitz.itch.io/godot-color-dither) is hosted on Itch.io.

## Instructions

A sample project is available in the `src` directory. Import this project into Godot 4 to test the shaders. To use the color dither shaders in your project, you will need to include the shader files located at `src/color_dither/shaders`. Assign the appropriate shader variant to your nodeâ€™s material, then select a dither palette image for the material.

## Locality and transparency

There are two types of shaders: Postprocessors and regular shaders. 

- The postprocessors operate in screen space, meaning that the color dither will appear to be *fixed* in world space. Sprites moving will have the dither scroll across them. 
- The regular shaders operate in local space, meaning that the dither will follow the sprite/mesh. This causes less flickering, but may be undesirable for transparency. 

To accommodate the case where you want to both have fixed and non-fixed dithering, you should use regular shaders, and instead offset the dither using the uniforms called `pixel_offset` and `alpha_pixel_offset`. These uniforms simply offset the dither in local space. See the `tweener.gd` script for a sample how to use these parameters to make the dither static in the world.

## Dither palette

Dither palette images serve as lookup tables for color mixes, translating the original color into a UV coordinate on the image. The red component selects one of 16 columns, each containing pixels arranged in a 16x16xN grid, where N represents the number of mixing colors. A dither value selects the row, and blue and green components select a pixel within the 16x16 tile.

To create your own dither palette, you can use the `dither_palette_generator.gd` editor script. Assign it to the scene, and assign a `Palette Image` containing the original colors in the inspector, and the `Dither Color Count` with the number of colors to mix together approximate the original color. Using 1 color would make the dithering shader a simple color replacement shader. For dithering, 2 to 4 colors seem appropriate.

The following is an example of a four color dither palette [CGA Palette 0](https://lospec.com/palette-list/cga-palette-0-high):

Other palettes included are [Commodore 64](https://lospec.com/palette-list/commodore64), [CGA](https://lospec.com/palette-list/color-graphics-adapter), [1bit Monitor Glow](https://lospec.com/palette-list/1bit-monitor-glow), [Sweetie 16](https://lospec.com/palette-list/sweetie-16)

The dithering algorithms used in color selection for the dither palette images are based on code and algorithms by Joel Yliluoma. A dithering pattern with over 2 colors uses the gamma-corrected algorithm, while an alternative algorithm is used for dithering patterns with 2 colors.

The shaders work best at low resolutions or low-resolution viewports and *does not pixelize* the screen.

## Shaders

There are four shader variations:

- **color_dither_2d**: Dithering shader for [Sprites](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.5/classes/class_sprite.html) and [TextureRect](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_texturerect.html). Supports screendoor transparency.
- **color_dither_post_2d**: Dithering postprocessing shader for 2D which applies dithering to the entire screen. Does not support screendoor transparency. Easiest way to use is to assign it to a fullscreen [ColorRect](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_colorrect.html)
- **color_dither_3d**: Dithering shader for 3D nodes such as [MeshInstance3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_meshinstance3d.html). Supports screendoor transparency.
- **color_dither_post_3d**: Dithering postprocessing shader for 3D which applies dithering to the entire screen. Does not support screendoor transparency. Easiest way to use is to assign it to a [MeshInstance3D](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_meshinstance3d.html) with a 2x2 [QuadMesh](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_quadmesh.html)
